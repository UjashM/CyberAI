                        areas that help make the University at Albany an R1 research university. Many of our faculty are supported by external research grants, such as grants from 
                        the National Science Foundation (NSF) or Simons Foundation. Our strongest areas of research are in algebra, analysis, combinatorics, geometry and topology, 
                        and probability and statistics. Reseachers from around the world come to speak in our various seminars and colloquia. In addition to providing our undergraduates 
                        with a solid foundation in mathematics, we are home to approximately 100-120 graduate students enrolled in one of our many graduate programs.
